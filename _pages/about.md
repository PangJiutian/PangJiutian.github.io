# About Me

Hi, I'm Qi Pang, a second-year Master's student at Xi'an Jiaotong University, where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Jinghuai Gao. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree from Shenyang Aerospace University.

I am passionate about solving seismic inverse problems, with a particular focus on leveraging machine learning techniques. In parallel, I have a strong interest in geological modeling, where physics-based simulations enable the construction of realistic synthetic data.

I am always open to academic collaborations. My specific research interests include:

- **Seismic inversion guided by multi-source information** (based on diffusion models or Transformers)
- **Geological modeling** (based on diffusion models or VAEs)

# A Few Publications (more to come, I hope)

## Current Research Topics: Petrophysical Inversion/Diffusion Model

Reservoir characterization seeks to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of subsurface properties to better understand fluid flow. Diffusion models, with their powerful learned priors, flexibly integrate various data sourcesâ€”such as forward models, well logs, seismic facies, and RGTâ€”to reduce the non-uniqueness of inversion. This integration of generative modeling with geophysical inversion is what inspires my research interest in this field.

## Previous Research Topic: Seismic Impedance Inversion/Transformer/CNN

My research journey began during my Masterâ€™s studies, focusing on seismic impedance inversion. Over time, my work progressed from TV to more adaptive structural constraints, from 1D to 2D inversion with improved lateral continuity, and from traditional model-driven approaches to deep learning methods with stronger nonlinear representation capabilitiesâ€”ranging from CNNs to globally-aware Transformers. These experiences not only deepened my understanding of inverse problems but also fueled my motivation to further explore the underlying theories and methodologies.
